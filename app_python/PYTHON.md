# Framework choice

I decided to use Django framework for this project, because it is wide-used, open-source and very friendly to beginners.
Also, it has full and good documentation with lots of different tutorials and a lot of users, which means that it is easy to solve any problem I could face with.
Despite that Django is an easy-to-start framework, it is very powerful, because some big applications implemented on it (e.g. Instagram, Spotify).
