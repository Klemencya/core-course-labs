## Framework choice

I decided to use Django framework for this project, because it is wide-used, open-source and very friendly to beginners.
Also, it has full and good documentation with lots of different tutorials and a lot of users, which means that it is easy to solve any problem I could face with.
Despite that Django is an easy-to-start framework, it is very powerful, because some big applications implemented on it (e.g. Instagram, Spotify).

## Used best practices
- Regular Commits (used isolated commits for each step of the project)
- Descriptive Commit Messages (each commit has clear and full description of what was done)

## Testing and code quality
- For testing, I used build-in local Django server that detects every code change and deploys it immediately, so that the page http://127.0.0.1:8000/ always shows actual page content.
- I implemented an easy-to-understand, consistent, easy testable and free of bugs code to ensure code quality.
