## Framework choice

I decided to use Spring framework for this project, because it is wide-used, well-documented, powerful and has initial project generation feature - https://start.spring.io/ that makes it easy to start. Also, it supports both Java and Kotlin.

## Used best practices
- Regular Commits (used isolated commits for each step of the project).
- Descriptive Commit Messages (each commit has clear and full description of what was done).

## Testing and code quality
- For testing, I deployed an application every time using `Intellij IDEA` "Run" button and opened page http://127.0.0.1:8080 in my web browser.
- Also, I implemented an easy-to-understand, single-responsible (different features in different controllers), consistent, easy testable and free of bugs code to ensure code quality.
